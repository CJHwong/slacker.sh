# execlines.awk — which physical lines of a bash script can produce an xtrace
# record. This is the denominator for coverage.sh; getting it wrong is the
# difference between a real number and a demoralizing fake one.
#
# Two facts about bash drive the whole design (both verified empirically on
# bash 5.3 and 3.2 with a PS4 line stamp):
#
#  1. Bash traces *commands*, not lines. A 20-line jq program in single quotes is
#     one command and emits one record. Counting its interior as 19 uncovered
#     lines would peg every action near 40% no matter how well tested it is.
#  2. A multi-line command is reported at its *first* line — EXCEPT a command
#     containing a `(` group (a `$(...)` substitution, a subshell, an array
#     assignment), which is reported at the line where the last group closes
#     (even when the command continues past it). An operator-led continuation
#     (`|| { …; return 1; }`, `| jq …`) is a separate command and is reported
#     at its own line.
#
# So this predicts the first line of each multi-line command, the group close
# line when a `(` is present, and operator-led continuation lines. Quotes,
# backslash continuations, and heredoc bodies are tracked because no
# line-oriented filter can guess them. Modelling the interior more aggressively
# (predicting every continuation line) was measurably worse: it invented misses
# on argument-continuation lines like `--arg id "$fileid"` that bash never
# reports.
#
# Also skipped, because bash emits no record for them:
#   - blanks and comments
#   - pure block syntax (fi / done / esac / else / then / do / braces / ;;),
#     including a closer followed by a case terminator (`fi ;;`) or a heredoc
#     (`done <<EOF`)
#   - case-pattern labels (`foo)` and `foo|bar)`), including a trailing comment
#     or an empty body (`foo) ;;`)
#   - function definition headers (defining is not executing)
#
#   awk -f execlines.awk -v mode=count file   -> the count
#   awk -f execlines.awk -v mode=list  file   -> one executable line number per line
#
# coverage.sh unions this with the lines bash actually traced, so a miss here
# can only ever cost a little accuracy, never silently inflate the percentage.
# SLACKER_COV_AUDIT=1 prints the gap between prediction and observation.
